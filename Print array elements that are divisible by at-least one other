#Given an array of length N that contains only integers, the task is to print the special numbers of array. A number in this array is called Special number if it is divisible by at least one other number in the array.

#code
from collections import defaultdict
def special_number(arr):
    arr.sort()
    n = len(arr)
    seta=set()
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] !=0:
            for j in range(i+1,n):
                if arr[j]%arr[i]==0:
                    seta.add(arr[j])
    print(seta)
#Testing        
arr = [ 2, 3, 8, 6, 9, 10]
special_number(arr)

#Output: {8, 9, 10, 6}
