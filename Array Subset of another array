#Given two arrays: a1[0..n-1] of size n and a2[0..m-1] of size m. Task is to check whether a2[] is a subset of a1[] or not. Both the arrays can be sorted or unsorted. It may be assumed that elements in both array are distinct.

def isSubset( a1, a2, n, m):
    hasha = set()
    for i in range(n):
        hasha.add(a1[i])
    for i in range(m):
        if a2[i] not in hasha:
            return "No"
    return "Yes"
